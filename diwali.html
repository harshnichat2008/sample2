        <p>During the festival of Diwali, people light up their homes and commercial outlets. Lord Ganesh is worshipped for prosperity and welfare whereas Goddess Lakshmi is worshipped for wisdom and wealth. The festival usually falls in the months of November or October and is celebrated to mark the return of Lord Rama from 14 years of exile. In many parts of the country, the festival is celebrated for five consecutive days. Undoubtedly, it is the most famous Indian festival, which is regarded as a celebration of life.</p>
